Part 2: Unity projects.

# Lecture 8

Note: the `helicopter` project was created with Unity 2018.1.0b13,
but there is some bug and it hangs when trying to import sounds.

The 2018.4.28f1 works.

Procedure is the following:

* Create Unity account
* Download Unity Hub from the unity website (not the editor! the hub!)
* Install the Hub
* Start it, login to Unity account
* Swtich to "Installs" and click "Install Editor"
* Switch to the "Archive" tab
* Click the download archive link
* It opens https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive
* Find "Unity 2018.4.28" on the page
* Click "Unity Hub" button
* It will switch back to the Hub application
* Install the editor

Do not open the project just yet!

Install Blender 2.79b from this page: https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.79/ (there is 2.79, but only tar.gz, download dmg installer for
2.79b).

Once blender is installed, open the helicopter project.

If the scene is empty, find the Scenes in the Project tree and double click
the main scene (the box with Unity icon titled "Main", not the "Main" folder).

Information from the [project page](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/projects/8/helicopter/):

> Downloading Blender
> Make sure to download the correct (older!) version of Blender, not the latest version, per these instructions!
> ... head [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/beta) to download version 2.79
> of Blender ...
> ... you can find the helicopter, skyscrapers, and airplane
> in the `Assets/Resources/Models` folder of the Unity project
> You can find some fantastic learning resources
[here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/) and

> has worked well for them on a variety of different operating systems,
> if the below doesn’t work for you.

> You will need to download Unity before you can run the distro code
> follow the link [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/beta) to download Unity’s

> Once you’ve downloaded and logged in to Unity, click the “Open” button
> on the launcher and browse to the folder of the cloned code from the distro.
>
> But wait… nothing seems to load into the scene once you’ve opened it!
> With the project open in Unity, navigate to Assets/Resources/Scenes,
> and then select Main in the file browser at the bottom of the screen,
> double-clicking to open, and all should be loaded into the scene view!

> Note: If you find that some of the models in your scene are not showing up,
> it’s likely because you either don’t have Blender installed yet
> (see instructions above), or you opened the project prior to the
> Blender installation.
> If you already have Blender installed and still don’t see anything,
> do just right-click, in the Unity editor, any of the models located in
> `Assets/Resources/Models` and select the Reimport All option,
> which should fix missing models after a few moments of loading!
